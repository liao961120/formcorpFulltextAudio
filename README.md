Full-Text Audio
===============

The main purpose of this repo is to serve the map (`docs/map.json`) between full-text audio links (hosted in `docs/audio`) and the corresponding full-text filenames for  <https://corpus.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw>. 


To update full-text audio (story), place the new audio files in `docs/audio` and execute:

```sh
python main.py
```

This would create `docs/map.json`.
